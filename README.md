Vendor Search Tool: This project serves as a powerful resource designed to retrieve information about nearby locations based on specified keywords such as vendors, transporters, hotels, shops, and competitor companies. With this tool, users can effortlessly explore and gather details about various establishments in close proximity.

For instance, imagine the scenario where we aim to acquire information about all transportation services near Sector 83 in Gurgaon, India. By providing the latitude and longitude coordinates of Sector 83 and setting a desired radius—be it 5km, 10km, or any other preference—this tool will conduct a comprehensive search across Google Places' registered listings. As a result, we'll obtain an array of valuable details pertaining to transport businesses.

The information extracted includes the business name, physical address, contact number, website, rating, and other pertinent attributes. All of this data is efficiently organized and stored within an Excel file, enabling users to have a structured overview of the found establishments.

In essence, the Vendor Search Tool empowers users to effortlessly access and compile essential business details in a user-friendly format, streamlining the process of making informed decisions and discovering nearby resources.
